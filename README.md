research into RRT* based algorithms for path planning in dynamic environments
\
The `cpp` directory is a partially complete c++ implementation that was abandoned to to some integral design decisions that made it difficult to work with. The `python` directory contains code that was actually used. It is a working implementation of RRT* with a 2-dimensional matplotlib visualization.
